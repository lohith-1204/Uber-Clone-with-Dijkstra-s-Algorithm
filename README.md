# Uber-Clone-with-Dijkstra's-Algorithm

ðŸ”¹ Overview

A simple Uber-like ride-hailing system simulation built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The project uses Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm on a predefined graph (city map) to calculate the shortest path between source and destination.

ðŸ”¹ Tech Stack

Frontend: HTML, CSS (UI for map, ride booking)

Logic: JavaScript (Graph + Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm)

Data: Predefined graph representing city roads (nodes = locations, edges = distances)

ðŸ”¹ Features

Select source and destination from predefined city locations

Find shortest route using Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm

Display distance & path on screen
